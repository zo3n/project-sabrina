# project-sabrina
This project creates a competition between media files (images, videos) and makes you choose between two continuously until a winner arises with most points (being most often chosen as better than the other media)


Steps:
1) Extract files to some folder
2) Create folder called *med* in that folder
3) Place any media files in *med* folder
4) Launch *create.py* (it will generate a file called *media.json* in the same folder)
5) Launch *index.html*
6) Upload the *media.json* file
7) Let the games begin

Notes:
1) The leaderboard is not being sorted by points
2) The reason why there are entries in notes is because it's not 100% finished and it's rushed because it was just a challenge for myself to make this few months before i uploaded to github
3) If you are a professional developer in JavaScript it is possible that you will find some things which can be done better/cleaner and/or more optimized. However, in my defense this was merely for learning and to get it done as fast as possible, organization and/or simplicity was not planned because I didn't think I'd be uploading it on GitHub, but in the end it's on GitHub anyway because I need something to show to an interview amirite.
4) I didn't sleep yet so I hope I did the description well enoguh
